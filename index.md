## What is this?

**Free T-shirts** is a campaign that aims to spread the awareness of free
software (or open-source software) by extending on the Hacktoberfest. Through
this campaign, I hope to popularize the free software movement and better
demonstrate how free software can reach no limits when it is supported by a
generous and passionate community of coders, testers, writers, designers,
advocates, and awesome people who are genuinely commited to making the world a
better place.

What can you do with this repository?

1. :+1: **Improve it.** Make pull requests. Create additions, suggest fixes,
   commit deletions. Make it better than it was before, because that is how free
   software is developed.
2. :loudspeaker: **Spread it.** If delicious cookies (not browser cookies, the
   other cookies, especially chocolate ones) are worth sharing,
   _good free software_ is also worth sharing.
3. :memo: **Learn from it.** New to Git or GitHub? Practice making commits,
   opening issues, and pulling pull requests on this repository.
4. :sunglasses: **Have fun with it.** Need something to occupy your time?
   Brainstorm for ways you can improve this repository. Make banners, create
   linting rules, or insert emojis into commit messages. Set contribution
   guidelines, paste flyers, or create GitHub Actions.

## Why?

~~Because everyone loves t-shirts, especially in October...~~

Yeah, I mean, we all love t-shirts. But Free T-shirts is much more than just
t-shirts.

**It is a fun & social campaign to advocate for the free software movement.**

We code because we want to solve problems. Sometimes it is not to solve
problems, but to make art. Sometimes it is meant for use in education. Whatever
the purpose of our software is, we make it available to all because we believe
in the power of sharing. Sharing awesome things.

**The Free T-shirts Campaign** thrives to capture that exact power that drives
us forward as a community. Just like many repositories on GitHub, it all began
with a blank readme file and a free software license. What happens next, you
decide. Keep in mind that this is not just simply where you can come and make
pull requests for your Hacktoberfest t-shirt. This is where there will be
resources for anyone who is a first-time contributor to open-source, as well as 
resources of all kinds for free software evangelists. And we need **_your_**
help to make this repository that - a home for free software lovers.

Please, contribute today. **Every pull request you make is a commit to a greater
cause.**
