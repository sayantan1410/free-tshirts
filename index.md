# What?

**Free T-shirts** is a campaign that aims to spread the awareness of free software (or open-source software) by extending on the Hacktoberfest. Through this campaign, I hope to popularize the free software movement and better demonstrate how free software can reach no limits when it is supported by a generous and passionate community of coders, testers, writers, designers, advocates, and awesome people who are genuinly commited to making the world a better place.

What can you do with this repository?

1. :+1: **Improve it.** Make pull requests. Create additions, suggest fixes, commit deletions. Make it better than it was before, because that is how free software is developed.
2. :loudspeaker: **Spread it.** If delicious cookies (not browser cookies, the other cookies, especially chocolate ones) are worth sharing, _good free software_ is also worth sharing.
3. :memo: **Learn from it.** New to Git or GitHub? Practice making commits, opening issues, and pulling pull requests on this repository.
4. :sunglasses: **Have fun with it.** Need something to occupy your time? Brainstorm for ways you can improve this repository. Make banners, create linting rules, or insert emojis into commit messages. Set contribution guidelines, paste flyers, or create GitHub Actions.

# Why?

~~Because everyone loves t-shirts, especially in October...~~

Yeah, I mean, we all love t-shirts. But Free T-shirts is much more than just t-shirts.

**It is a fun & social campaign to advocate for the free software movement.**

When free software flourishes, software users have freedom, control, and security. When free software flourises, sharing a computer program becomes easy and risk-free. When free software flourishes, children can learn how computers work. When free software flourishes, organizations can collaborate on and share a grand framework.

**When free software flourises, the world will be a better place.**

# Q & A

## Where are my t-shirts?

Free T-shirts is a campaign that extends upon the Hacktoberfest, which occurs annually in October. Hacktoberfest awards a t-shirt for anyone who opens 5 pull requests in October. The t-shirts will be provided to you by GitHub once you have met the requirements. In another word, the _t-shirts_ part of this campaign is completely on the GitHub side. Free T-shirts has no direct affiliation with Hacktoberfest or GitHub. We do not guarantee that you will receive a t-shirt, and we are not responsible if you do not receive any t-shirt.

## Anything else other than t-shirts?

Fun badges are on their way! ;)
