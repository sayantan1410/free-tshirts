## Free software

### What is the difference between "free software" and "open-source software"?

The terms _free software_ and _open-source software_ are exactly the same in
meaning; they both refer to software that gives its users the 4 essential
freedoms:
0. The freedom to run the software
1. The freedom to modify the software
2. The freedom to distribute the software
3. The freedom to distribute modified versions of the software

"Open-source software" is newer and more popular in usage. However, the Free
Software Foundation (<https://fsf.org>) advocates for the usage of the older
term _free software_, as it has an emphasis on freedom.

## Campaign

### What is Hacktoberfest?

It is an annual celebration of the open-source community! Read on the [official
webpage](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

### Where are my t-shirts?

You can claim your t-shirts by participating in Hacktoberfest. The Free T-shirts
Campaign only provides a repository for you to make pull requests to with the
main purpose of advocating for free (or open-source) software.

### Is there anything else other than t-shirts?

Fun badges are on their way! :wink:
